 Mobile apps made by me
 The health diary app is on my desktop computer, not currently available to me. I will add it here probably on 27-29.1
 UPDATE 29.1
 Android Studios gives blank screen when I try to build my app, and complains about sdk version. I'll try to fix this before uploading my app. It's nothing too advance anyway...
